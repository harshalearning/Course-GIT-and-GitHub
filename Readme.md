Why we need GIT - Open source, collabration and Forking.

Installation of GIT: It is different for all the OS, we have different commands for windows, linux and Mac.

    In our learning we will learn the commands for Windows machine.

Git Foundations: 

    GIT Architecture
    Configuring git
    Commit the local written files using GIT
    Add SSH or Http copy, to communicate with the VC tool.
    Create key-gen for first time.
    Add your files to the remote connrction.
    Pull the files to check if they are up-to date in repository.
    Push the files to VC tools.
    Creating branches to push your individual code.


GIT FOUNDATIONS:


GIT ARCHETECTURE:

    Initilize git in local folder.
    GIT is 3 tire archetecture - Localfiles, Staging area and Repository.
    Best approch: Localfiles --> Staging area --> Repository.
    GIT HUB, GIT LAB and BIT BUCKET --> Personal Favourites.

Initilizing GIT:

    We create a folder from our system directory to keep track of files we are working on, when working files we will closely look for text files in our examples (.txt).
    So the GIT keeps the track of everything for the created file, while working VS code or powershell. As we will have terminal by default in VS code we will be working on our files using VS code.

GIT Commit and LOG Messages:

    We need few commands that are mandatory while working with GIT, those are mentioned in the GITCommands file.
    For commiting a file we first need to add the file to staging directory and then commit the file, with any message, which is mandatory for understanding purpose.

GIT Checksum and SHA:

  Hashes or SHA used to move further and backer using the code.
  SHA: 40 charecter SHA-1 [0-9 and a-f]. If anything is changed , even a small change it produces a new code, which is your 40 charecter id length. 

  SHA bascially store the code of the previous commit/parent and the data, author, messages. It basically helps to get back in time. The whole is known as checksum, which is created with each commit.

Heads:It is something that always points the tip of present commit. It basically points the current place where you are, whether it is main, branch or some other file in your VScode.
